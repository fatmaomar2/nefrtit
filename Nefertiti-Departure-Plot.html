        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2"> For
more than a century Nefertiti’s bust has been suffering from loneliness in Europe.
Since 1920 Egypt, and Germany have been fighting each other about owning the
bust, because it is a very unique masterpiece. It was made of limestone,
coloured plaster, and wore a conical headdress<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1">[185]<!--[endif]--></a>. All these
aspects made the bust a unique masterpiece, it was discovered in 1912 by Ludwig
Borchardt in Tell el-Amarna in a workshop which belongs to Thutmose who was the
court sculptor<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-2">[186]<!--[endif]--></a>. The
bust went to James Simon who was the sponsor of the mission, led by
the German oriental society<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-3">[187]<!--[endif]--></a>. This
society was founded in 1898 to hold studies of antiquity in the near, and
Middle East. Borchardt did his best to make sure that the bust would be from
the German side. According to the partage law, and regulations at that time,
all recurring and common artefacts of any discovery would be divided between
the Egyptian Antiquities Authority and the foreign mission concerned, while the
unique, and distinctive artefacts must be placed in the Egyptian share<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-4">[188]<!--[endif]--></a>.
Wafaa El-Seddiq is the head of the International Union for the Preservation of
heritage, and the former director of the Egyptian museum said that according to
documentation, and the diary of Borchardt deduced that he knew that the bust
belonged to Nefertiti from the first day of discovery. He described the statue
as gypsum, not limestone, also the name was mentioned as (an unknown royal
family princess). The fact is he knew the true identity so he falsified the
description to prove that The statue is a normal one, and it is not important
so the bust went to the German share<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-5">[189]</a>.<br>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-default u-text-1"> Until
1924 the bust was hidden, its first appearance was in the Egyptian Museum in
Berlin. The Egyptian government was very surprised to see the statue and began
to threaten the German excavation to ban them from doing excavation in Egypt
until the restitution of the bust, but the German did not care about this
threat. In 1929 other artifacts were placed to be exchanged with the bust by
the Egyptian government, but German declined,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[190]<!--[endif]--></a> These

Another attempt to restitute the bust by the Egyptian government was done and
in the beginning, Adolf Hitler who was the Nazis leader did not mind to return
the bust, but after he saw it he had fallen in love with the bust and refused
the restitution. Eberhard von Stürer, the German ambassador in Egypt had been
told by Hitler a message to send to the Egyptian government “I am one of the
big fans of the queen Nefertiti, she brings me joy to my heart, the bust is a
masterpiece and a unique treasure. I am planning to build a new Egyptian museum
in Berlin. I am dreaming of this. I will build inside a room surmounted by a
great dome, and the magnificent Nefertiti will sit a crowned queen in the
middle of it, and I will never give up the queen's head”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-3">[192]</a>.<br>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-default u-text-2"><b><i><u>“The
lovely woman is no more”</u></i></b>
          <br>After
the end of WWII in 1970 specially in Berlin, something disastrous happened,
Steffen Wenig, the curator on the duty on the museum island ordered his
colleagues to come back to work during their vacation for an urgent meeting. He
started his talk saying “Nefertiti the lovely woman, is no more, a visitor
child knocked over the statue, and fell on the floor causing it to shatter. The
statue mentioned belongs to Nefertiti that was found on November 26,1912 by the
Egyptologist Hermann Ranke. The statue was as fragments on the floor between
room 19, and 18 in the so-called house of the sculptor Thutmose. The statue was
broken in ancient times, they collected the fragments, and reconstructed it in
the Berlin museum. The statue is made of limestone as the bust of Nefertiti.
After around 57 years the statue was broken in the Berlin museum under the
authority of the museum curator, and German authority. The head was broken into
seven parts, the neck was broken into four pieces, and the rest of the body was
shattered into many pieces. After the accident of the statue Uta von Eickstedt
is the restorer who worked on it, his restoration for the statue was not
correct according to Venice charter 1964
(before the accident 1970 happened). The restorer used metal splint instead of
limestone to reconstruct the statue, also he did not reconstruct the right hand
which its reconstruction was possible due to plaster replicas. All these restoration
works according to Venice charter 1964 article No 9 which states that <i><u>“The process of restoration is a highly
specialized operation. Its aim is to preserve and reveal the aesthetic and
historic value of the monument and is based on respect for original material
and authentic documents. It must stop at the point where conjecture begins, and
in this case moreover any extra work which is indispensable must be distinct
from the architectural composition and must bear a contemporary stamp. The restoration
in any case must be preceded and followed by an archaeological and historical
study of the monument”</u></i>
          <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-4">[193]<!--[endif]--></a>.
According to all the accidents, and series mentioned above the antiquities
suffer from smuggling by the west, do not have a proper preservation standard,
nor will they get proper conservation works as Nefertiti’s statue had.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-default u-text-3"> The
accidents of antiquities are still continuous even in the twenty-first century,
such as the fire of the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris on April 15, 2019, and
the spraying of olive oil on the Egyptian monuments in the Berlin Museum on
October 23, 2020, as well as the explosion of the Humboldt Forum in Berlin on
April 8, 2020. All these events are a small part of a large series of accidents
that occur in international museums, which they claim are equipped with the
highest levels of safety. This part will provide all of these accidents.</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> In
the first half of the 20th century the interest in Egyptology in Europe had
reached its peak, this also generated the desire to acquire other types of
antiquities. The Europeans started to challenge each other to collect
magnificent antiquities as national collections for their countries, and
private ones as Sir John Soane private collection 8. In 1939 World War II started,
led by Adolf Hitler whose dream was to control the world and to collect all the
antiquities in Europe. It was clearly a turbulent period; Due to the widespread
plundering and the nations' desire to protect their national treasures steps
were taken to secure and move their most precious artifacts. His project was
titled Hitler's Dream, it was to construct a huge museum in the Austrian city
of Linz, many works of art were collected for the project. By the end of the
war, there were Nazis speculating about the secret locations where many works
would be concealed, and in the event of real defeat, Hitler ordered them to
destroy every piece they had.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-default u-text-3"> During
1943, the works of art had been transferred to different mines in Altaussee,
Merkers, and a copper mine at Siegen. Michelangelo’s Madonna (Virgin Mary) of
Bruges that was stolen from the church of Virgin Mary, and Jan van Eyck’s Ghent
Altarpiece stolen from Saint Bavo Cathedral were hidden in the Altaussee mine.

1939. Unfortunately, at the end of WWII the painting was not found, it may have
been destroyed as Hitler’s ordered his men at the end of war to destroy all the

hinges and could be opened and closed<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-2">[196]<!--[endif]--></a>. The panel
displayed at Saint Bavo Cathedral in Ghent, Belgium with the rest of panels as
a complex painting. On April 10, 1934, it was stolen by Belgian Arsène Goedertier. The Altarpiece was the
most sought-after artwork by the Nazis at the time; Göring wanted it for his
own collection, and Hitler wanted it as the center of his citywide
super-museum.<br>
