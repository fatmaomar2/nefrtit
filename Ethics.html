        <h2 class="u-align-left u-text u-text-1">Ethics</h2>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> In
the past, the Egyptians asked the Berlin Museum to restitution one of the most
important cultural properties of the Egyptian community for the head of Queen
Nefertiti in different methods, but all attempts failed. There is no good
reason why the Egyptians should not recover their cultural rights from the head
statue of Nefertiti. In fact, since the statue of Queen Nefertiti's head was
stolen from Egypt and placed in the Berlin Museum, the Germans have helped to
form and build a strong tangible and intangible heritage identity. Therefore,
it is ethical to respect the opinion of Egyptians, whether children, women, or
men, to obtain a strong heritage identity like them because they really deserve
to receive their cultural symbol. According to the ICOM Code of Ethics,
Paragraph No. 6, each museum piece includes the nature of the cultural heritage
of the environment in which it is made and reflects through it the national&nbsp;identity and ownership of the
communities<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1">[140]<!--[endif]--></a>. This
moral text ICOM Code applies to the head of the Nefertiti statue because it was
made in Egypt and represents a strong Egyptian woman, so the right imposed is
that it remains in the environment among the society in which it was created.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-default u-text-3"> Paragraph 6 of the ICOM Code of
Ethics states the following: <i>&nbsp;</i>
          <br><i>''6.2 Return of
Cultural Property&nbsp;</i>
          <br>Museums should be prepared to
initiate dialogues for the return of cultural property to a country or people
of origin<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-2">[141]<!--[endif]--></a>. This
should be undertaken in an impartial manner, based on scientific, professional,
and humanitarian principles as well as applicable local, national and
international legislation, in preference to action at a governmental or
political level<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-3">[142]<!--[endif]--></a>. <br><i>6.3 Restitution of
Cultural Property</i>
          <br>When a country or people of origin
seeks the restitution of an object or specimen that can be demonstrated to have
been exported or otherwise transferred in violation of the principles of
international and national conventions, and shown to be part of that country’s
or people’s cultural or natural heritage, the museum concerned should, if
legally free to do so, take prompt and responsible steps to co-operate in its
return<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-4">[143]<!--[endif]--></a>. <br><i>6.4 Cultural Objects<br>from an Occupied Country</i> Museums should abstain from
purchasing or acquiring cultural objects from an occupied territory and
respectfully all laws and conventions that regulate the import, export, and
transfer of cultural or natural materials.''<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-5"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[144]<!--[endif]--></a> The significance of the bust of Nefertiti can be
seen in its meaning and representation for Egyptian society, particularly for
women. In modern Egyptian culture, it is still regarded as a highly significant
symbol for women. Various objects are all part of Egypt's cultural heritage,
representing both the past and the present<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-6">[145]<!--[endif]--></a>. It is the
legacy that enhances the culture and appreciation for it, as well as the
people's identity. The significance of people and their culture, rather than
the material importance of the objects themselves, should be the focus of
heritage. The bust of Neferititi is always seen in the oriental narrative of
"the most beautiful woman"<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-7">[146]</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-default u-text-4"> The
bust depicts an important character in Egyptian history, and her role defines a
lot of arguments in gender studies and the role of women in society. The
various descriptions of Nefertiti and other Egyptian women demonstrate how the
“male-dominated ideology of Western stereotypes of the Orient has been
uncritically propagated, and how the bust was used to create new identities and
assimilate to ancient Egypt”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-8"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[147]<!--[endif]--></a> rather than being studied and appreciated for its true representations. One of
the most notable depictions of Nefertiti was during the 2011 uprising, where
the image of the bust was modified to wear a gas mask to show support for women
facing police violence<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-9">[148]<!--[endif]--></a>. The
use of Nefertiti's bust was “not influenced by Western imperialism, but rather
by indigenous communities of women and feminists calling on an ancestral image
of power”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-10">[149]<!--[endif]--></a>. This
is just one example of Nefertiti's vast historical significance in modern
Egyptian society.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-default u-text-5"> The main ethical case for
Nefertiti's repatriation is summed up in how she has been kept for political
and economic power as an "ambassador for Berlin”. The implications of this
are that its historical and cultural significance is overlooked, and the
numerous Egyptian requests for its return or repatriation over the years have
been denied or dismissed. When cultural material is displayed outside of its
original region, it loses context, which provides additional information about
that item. The impact of Nefertiti being in the place she truly belongs and
appreciating the sentiment behind it for the sake of history would not only
empower Egyptians but also have a slew of positive social, economic, and
political implications. It is also important to question museums' due
diligence, and in this case, Borchardt's unethical behaviour and how it left
Egypt is an important ethical topic to discuss.<br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-default u-text-6"> On
the basis of repatriation, it should be remembered that many artefacts were
removed when Egypt was oppressed or incapable of preventing removal, and that
the museum that holds them has no real right to that object<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-11">[150]<!--[endif]--></a>. Even
in terms of legality, the Bust of Nefertiti was smuggled, with Borchardt
purposefully giving Egypt the impression that it was of little value, even
lying about the material it was made of. Gert von Paczensky demonstrated in his
1984 book "<i>Nefertiti Wants to Go
Home</i>" that the division of the site at the time was also legally questionable<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-12">[151]<!--[endif]--></a>. Legalities
in repatriation are important, but in order to solidify relationships, a
significant shift in consciousness and perception is required. This
necessitates fewer legal and political solutions and more ethical ones. <br>

        <h3 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1"><b>Negotiations
for the repatriation of Nefertiti</b>
        </h3>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> In 1913, as a result of a mistake
made by both the representative of the Antiquities Service and Professor
Borchardt, director of the German Archaeological Institute, the head of Queen
Nefertiti was sent to Berlin following the excavation discoveries at Amarna.
When Egypt realized the value of the statue and the circumstances in which it
was seized by Germany a few decades later, there was an uproar in 1923 over
export conditions, which largely prevented renewed German excavations until
1929<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1">[152]<!--[endif]--></a>. The
Egyptian Antiquities Authority made a new application for an excavation license
in 1925, deeming it expedient to demand the return of the head as a condition
before any further excavations were allowed<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-2">[153]<!--[endif]--></a>. From the
initial negotiations and attempts to retrieve the bust of Queen Nefertiti, the
German government replied that it did not agree with the Egyptian government,
claiming that the license was valid, and that in 1911 Dr. James Simon, through
Mr. Borchardt, participated in the discovery and then donated the bust to the
Berlin Museum. Since then, the Egyptian government has been negotiating and
making demands for its return over the years<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-3">[154]</a>.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-default u-text-3"> Various
notes were sent in 1927, from that of Saifullah Yusri Pasha, the Egyptian
negotiating minister in Berlin, who communicated with the German government,
and other notes on June 13 to explain the Egyptian government's point of view
and its request for mediation with the German government to return the statue
of Nefertiti.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-4"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[155]<!--[endif]--></a> 1929
was a particularly important year for the negotiations over the bust of
Nefertiti, in a note written by Mr. Schäfer in agreement with Mr. Lacau in
October, he stated that once Lacau had a more accurate knowledge of the bust,
it became clear to him that this piece should not have come out of Egypt, and
that Borchardt had erred<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-5">[156]<!--[endif]--></a>.
Borchardt believed that Lacau was accusing him of unacceptable machinations, an
impression reinforced by the official accusations from the local Egyptian press and its constant criticism of
Borchardt's actions<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-6">[157]<!--[endif]--></a>. The
bust of Queen Nefertiti entered the public property of the Prussian state, so
it could only be removed from the House of Antiquities in Berlin by law
submitted to the Prussian parliament, and it was agreed that these procedures
would be left for that time in focus of confidentiality regarding plans to
return the bust. This was especially important with claims that government
figures are too afraid of the news to break in the newspapers before a
conclusion is reached, because the German public is infatuated with the bust
and inevitably frustrated with each draft agreement of its return, a narrative
that continues to this day, and that it is better to confront this issue once
its repatriation becomes official<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-7">[158]</a>.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-default u-text-4"> Thus, in regard to the recovery of
the statue at that time, the German Foreign Ministry expressed that it decided
not to interfere in this matter at all for fear of arousing public opinion
against it and that the government’s political enemies could exploit this
incident for their political ends, as stated in various letters to Hassan
Nashat in response to developments related to the negotiations. Lacau refused
to calm down in this matter, and raised the decision to the Antiquities
Committee, so that the Berlin Museum, the Orient Institute-Giselle Schaft, and
the German Archaeological Institute in Cairo could no longer obtain any license
for excavation, until a solution satisfactory to all parties was found, and he
explained his thinking by comparing sharing excavations finds as not a
discussion of conflicting interests, but the duty of colleagues to complete the
sharing in half in an amicable and fair manner<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-8">[159]</a>.<br>

The previous caricature on the left was inspired by
the 1929 visit of king Fuad to Germany, during which the king requested that
the bust be returned to Egypt. However, the German public opinion saw it as an
opportunity to humiliate one of Britain’s former colony that still has
formidable ties the the empire. The request was denied afterwards in 1934 by
Hitler himself saying that the queen will stay prisoner in Germany, which shows
that the whole situation is just another card to inflict pain on the
affiliation of the Egyptian kingdom with it’s former colonizers.
